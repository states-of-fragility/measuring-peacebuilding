<h1>Tracking investments into Peacebuilding activities</h1>
 
<aside></aside>
 
<p>This sankey diagram visualizes how expenditures directed towards Peacebuilding activities can be measured using the OECD's <a href="https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=CRS1">ODA Data</a>. It is based on the peacebuilding framework proposed by the Institue for Peace and Economics in their report <a href="http://economicsandpeace.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Measuring-Peacebuilding_WEB.pdf">"Measuring Peacebuilding Cost-Effectiveness"</a>, 2017. The chords connect the activity areas with the respective <a href="http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/purposecodessectorclassification.htm">purpose codes</a> of the OECD <a href="http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/dacandcrscodelists.htm">Creditor Reporting System</a>.</p>
